Our game includes an optional crash reporting feature powered by BugSplat. This feature is designed to help us improve the stability and performance of the game. Here’s how it works:

- **Data Use:** The information collected through crash reports is used solely for debugging and improving the game. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

# 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal information with third parties. However, when you opt-in to send crash reports, the data is transmitted to BugSplat’s servers. BugSplat’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://bugsplat.com/privacy/).
