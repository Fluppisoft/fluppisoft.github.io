For the longest time, Brick Rigs has only been available in English and German (the two languages I am somewhat comfortable with). Manually translating the game into more languages would have been time consuming and require constant rework when text is changed in an update. With todays availability of good AI tools however, we decided we could build a program which could automatically translate the game for us into as many languages as we needed.

The problem with this approach is just that AI can make mistakes and doesn't always consider the context of the game correctly. That's why we need *your* help to improve the AI translations and to turn them into something that can be shipped with the next update.

The following languages are currently being translated:

- Arabic
- Bengali
- Chinese
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Japanese
- Korean
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Ukrainian

**A:** Edit the translation directly (this will not be possible if the translation has already been approved by a reviewer).<br>
**B:** Mark the translation as requiring to be improved by someone.<br>
**C:** Save the changes you made to the translation.<br>
**D:** Suggest a different translation (required if the current translation has already been approved).<br>

# Review

Once a sufficient amount of translations has been reviewed, we will invite the most active and reliable translators to become reviewers. They will then be able to review and approve final translations.
