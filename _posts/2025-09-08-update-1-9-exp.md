# Translations

With the help of AI tools we translated Brick Rigs into the following languages (additionally to English and German):

- Simplified Chinese
- Spanish
- French
- Portuguese
- Japanese
- Korean
- Russian
- Ukrainian
- Polish
- Arabic
- Hindi
- Bengali

Since the AI translations weren't perfect in many places we asked the community and some outside translators to help us improve them. If you still find issues in any translation (or even the original English strings), please suggest a new translation on our [Weblate Project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/brick-rigs/).

# Crash Reporter and Bug Tracker

When Brick Rigs crashes, you will now see a crash reporter window open. Here you can choose to send us crash reports with optional additional information. We also created a bug tracker using GitHub Issues, which you can find [here](http://bugs.brick-rigs.com/). These steps will help us find and fix bugs and especially crashes more efficiently and effectively than in the past.

# Linux Support

With update 1.9 we will launch the first native Linux version of Brick Rigs. Due to limitations of Steam however, this version can't be downloaded yet on the experimental branch.
