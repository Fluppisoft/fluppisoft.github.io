Update **1.10** is out on the **experimental branch** on Steam! Read on for some exciting new features:

# Editor groups

The new editor groups are going to make life just a bit easier for builders. They allow you to group any bricks together in order to be able to select and modify them more easily. This could previously be done via color coding, but editor groups make this more convenient. They do not have any effect outside of the editor.

# Welds

**WARNING:** This is a very experimental feature and subject to change!

This is probably the most exciting and paradigm shifting feature of this update. You can now 'weld' multiple bricks together in the editor, which makes them behave **as if they were one brick**. Welded bricks do not require connection points to connect and will never fall apart during gameplay. This should make building easier, require fewer bricks for connections and allow for even more creativity. But try to keep your weld groups small, e.g. just a bumper or a door in order to keep destruction physics satisfying.

# Pattern scale, rotation and offset

This feature has been requested for a long time, and finally, it's here! When you select a pattern for any brick, you can now change its scale, rotation and position.

# Unflip and teleport to last respawn point

Finally, you can unflip your vehicles without repairing them again, **just like in legacy**! Additionally, there is a new action to respawn your vehicle at the last spot where you teleported it. So if you placed your vehicle precisely for a race from free cam for example, your can respawn there again with the press of a button. This and unflip are bound to the **Enter key** by default (tap or hold).

# New rocket launcher model with sights

Since the old rocket launcher didn't have proper iron sights or a rail for sight attachments, I decided to update the entire model. The new model looks cleaner, has a more usable iron sight and allows you to attach scopes.

# Handgun ammo types

With a recent update it became possible to select the ammo type used on vehicle guns. But now you can also change the **ammo type of handguns**, on the fly! This is bound to the **Y key** by default. With this, you can fire **target seeking** rounds from the rocket launcher or **incendiary** rounds from the BR-15 for example!

# Admin access on servers

As most of you have probably seen, there has been a greyed out admin login field in the match menu for years. This feature has now been implemented and hosts can allow other users to gain admin rights on their servers via a password. This is disabled by default and can be enabled when hosting a server.

# New languages
