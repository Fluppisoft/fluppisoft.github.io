As of today, update **1.10** is officially out of the experimental stage and live on the main branch! Here’s what this update brings to the table:

# Editor groups and welds

Editor groups and welds are two pretty cool new features for builders. While they share a similar interface in the editor, they serve two completely different purposes:

## Editor groups

Allow you to group any bricks together so you can select and modify them more efficiently. This could previously be done via color coding, but editor groups make it much more convenient. They have no effect outside of the editor.

## Welds

Allow you to “weld” multiple bricks together in the editor, making them behave **as if they were a single brick**. Welded bricks do not require connection points and will never fall apart during gameplay. This should make building easier, reduce the number of bricks needed for connections, and allow for even more creativity. However, try to keep your weld groups small — for example, just a bumper or a door — to keep destruction physics satisfying.

# Pattern scale, rotation and offset

This feature has been requested for a long time — and now it’s finally here! When you select a pattern for any brick, you can now adjust its scale, rotation, and position.

# Unflip and teleport to last respawn point

Finally, you can unflip your vehicles without repairing them again, **just like in legacy**!

Additionally, there is a new action that respawns your vehicle at the last location you teleported it to. So if you precisely positioned your vehicle for a race using free cam, for example, you can respawn it there again with the press of a button.

Both this action and unflip are bound to the **Enter key** by default (tap or hold).

# New rocket launcher model with sights

Since the old rocket launcher didn’t have proper iron sights or a rail for attachments, I decided to update the entire model. The new version looks cleaner, has a more usable iron sight, and allows you to attach scopes.

# Handgun ammo types

A recent update made it possible to select the ammo type used on vehicle guns. Now you can also change the **ammo type of handguns** on the fly! This is bound to the **Y key** by default.

With this, you can fire **target-seeking** rounds from the rocket launcher or **incendiary** rounds from the BR-15, just to name two examples.

# Admin access on servers

As most of you have probably noticed, there has been a greyed-out admin login field in the match menu for years. This feature has now been implemented, and hosts can allow other users to gain admin rights on their servers via a password.

This is disabled by default and can be enabled when hosting a server.

# Performance optimizations

Based on work done by [Voultapher](https://github.com/Voultapher), this update introduces some pretty substantial performance improvements. Most notably, spawning vehicles is now much, much faster.

# New languages

In addition to all the languages that 1.9 added, there are nine more languages in 1.10:

- Italian  
- Turkish  
- Czech  
- Hungarian  
- Norwegian (Bokmål)  
- Swedish  
- Kazakh  
- Finnish  
- Thai  

# Other improvements

- Background vehicles in the main menu are back  
- New X and Y position sensor types  
- New equal and not-equal math brick operations  
- Automatically ban players after entering the server password too many times  

# Bug fixes

- Fixed capture points not being reset after warmup ends  
- Fixed city elevator height not being replicated correctly for clients
